#### Description:
CS50x Desscription: <br>
Studio Form originally goes back to a client project I did in November. Note here that I work as a freelance technical web developer in the no-code/low-code universe of webflow.com. <br>
My client wanted to create a fully customized, multi-step form with some conditional complexity. To make it short - the existing solutions on the market were not sufficient <br>.
With quite a lot of effort, I developed this framework that allows anyone - even absolute no-coders - to relatively easily create these complex, beautifully animated forms with conditional logic, error checking and a myriad of other useful features.

If you create a production version, make sure it is in the dist folder and has a correct version number so that jsDelivr and old users never lose access.
